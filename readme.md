# Front 3000

This is a Vue.js frontend application that can be configured to connect to any backend and perform CRUD operations using forms generated by objects with verification rules and data tables.

The application will have a mechanism of login and storing the token.

The app is under development and each time I am going to ask you to generate a part of the project as I describe it.

The backend folder is a fake backend with some data and a login endpoint for testing. In order to run the front app with this backend, use the start_servers.bat script.
